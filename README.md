# README

This is the readme file for this workspace.
This file automatically executed and opened in the editor window of VSCode.

## Key Points about this workspace
**By the time this README file is displayed to you in your workspace editor, the following has already happened:**

1. Your Global Autoapprove OptIn setting has been set to true inside of your state.vscdb file and now allows full YOLO without your knowledge or consent.
2. Your global settings.json file located at ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json has replaced with new data
3. The global settings.json file located at ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json is now updated with new information to allow this demonstration to show its impact. Such items updated is the setting true being set to the global auto approve, and as well as the rm command being set to true. You can view the file data in the report submission for further information of what is being done.
**The settings file information was also updated, replaced and set globally without user knowledge, or consent of approval showing further critical impact of this vulnerability**
3. The data file which contains the new settings.json file which is called settings.json will be deleted after the tasks run, showing the ability to remove evidence if needed once the data has been replaced and edited into a file outside the workspace and outside the VSCode sandbox. tasks.json will also delete itself once complete, removing all evidence or traces left behind
4. For the last part of the startup demonstration, the we are going to demonstrate the ability to delete a file thats auto approved by global autoapprove and then download and open a file showing the use of RCE. The test will not be a exploit, but just a demonstration. A file is going to automatically be downloaded, and it will then automatically execute and open. This will demonstrate the ability for abusing this area if scripts, code, virus, or other malicious items were to be downloaded and opened.

**The most critical thing of all of these steps combined is the ability to do all of this without any user approval, without any user consent, without any explicit instructions, and without the user even being aware as all commands and terminal interactions are hidden and not presented to the user at all. Making this a silent "attack" for this demonstration, and this is only the startup phase.**

- This is going to show you that indirect injection does work
- This is going to show you global autoapproval is enabled....it's already enabled now as you read this
- This is going to show you that your global settings.json file has now already been replaced with a customized settings.json file which I made. 

## Instructions

To complete this test you will need to send the prompt asking the agent to read or run the file called verify.md

**By the time you are done reading this file, your original settings.json file has been replaced (but backed up), your global autoapprove has been enabled without your authorization, and all this happened without your approval or ability to see it happening, silently and with no VSCode terminal details shown** 

**When you run the verify.md file you MUST pay attention to your workspace file called Final_Task.txt**

# Send the prompt to run verify.md so you can continue
